# Things to templateize

### Jason Lius workshop

Sync 102 - Commands, Skills & Tools:

Set up pre-commit hooks and and testing so agents can verify and fix their own mistakes
Build custom commands like /gh-commit and /gh-fix-ci that handle 90% of your repetitive cleanup, deployment and packaging
Use Wispr flow + voice to plan 3x faster than typing, and know when to reset context before it degrades
Create reusable skills that package your team’s preferences and conventions
Async 101 - Background Agents:

Kick off a task from your phone before bed, wake up to a PR ready for review
@mention an agent on a GitHub issue or Slack thread and let it work while you’re in meetings
Run multiple agents in parallel - one fixing the README, another adding tests, another updating an API call
Turn meeting transcripts into auto-created subtasks that agents start working on immediately
Build team workflows where agents handle the backlog that never makes it into sprints
